# RSA-Decrypt
It include a task that explains RSA algorithm and tries to decipher the plain text using some online services for mathematical calculations.
<h2>First try the question yourself using the below instructions and resources for RSA Algorithm</h2>
<p><strong>RSA algorithm</strong> is use to encrypt and decrypt messages and also used for Key exchange. </p><br>
<p>There are steps to create Public key and private key which is used for encryption and decryption </p>
<ol>
  <li>Take two prime number 'p' and 'q' ,such that they are very large prime numbers.</li>
  <li>Find 'n' using n=p*q</li>
  <li>Now find phi(n)=(p-1)*(q-1)</li>
  <li>Select 'e' such that 'e' is a co-prime to phi(n)</li>
  <li>Calculate 'd' such that e*d*mod(phi(n))=1</li>
</ol>
